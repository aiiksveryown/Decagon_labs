switchChar is a function that helps children in swapping values to return a new word
a word is a set of alphabets that obviously must not be a dictionary word

the children are offered three inputs:

inputChar: cade
actualChar: abcdefgh  (is a set of non-repeating alpha-characters)
changeChar: grdwqsdr

switchChar(inputChar, actualChar, changeChar) => dgwq


the result for this is => "dgwq"

you are to write a function that takes these values as arguments and return the result only if:

1) actualChar and changeChar are of the same length,
2) characters in actualChar are not repeated,
3) the length of inputChar is not longer than the length of actualChar
4) the characters in inputChar are contained in actualChar

if none of this conditions are met, here are the returned values

1) actualChar and changeChar are of not the same length returns => "Length mismatch"
2) characters in actualChar are repeated returns => 'Repeated value'
3) the length of inputChar is longer than the length of actualChar returns => -1
4) the characters in inputChar are not contained in actualChar -1


note:
actualChar is a set of none repeating characters of length (0 to N)
inputChar is a set of characters of length (0 to N-1)
changeChar is a set of characters of length (length of actualChar)
unmet conditions must return values


examples:
switchChar('decagon', 'lmnbvcxzasdfghjktyrueiwoqp', 'zdewsaqxcfrtgvbhyujnmkilop') => "rmacgle
switchChar('we', 'wkeap', 'mgren')â€‹â€‹â€‹ => "mr"
