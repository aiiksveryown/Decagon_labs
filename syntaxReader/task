A team of developers, have a project to build a new programming language using Javascript
they need a developer to build them a syntax reader for braces only to check if braces are properly closed
this determines if the syntax is correct or not.
your task is to build a syntax reader to check if syntax is correct or return the position of the error brace

given a string of syntax of length N containing only braces "[]{}()<>", 
check that the syntax is correct or return the position of the wrong braces
if correct return "ok", if wrong, return the position of the first error.


constraint:
0 <= N <= 100000000
N contain only these characters {}[]()<>

For example: 
readSyntax('{{}}') => 'ok'
readSyntax('[[>]') => 2
readSyntax('[[>]{}()<>') => 2
