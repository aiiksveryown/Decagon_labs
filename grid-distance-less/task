You know what a grid means?
Dennis is trying to figure out the shortest grid distance to his destination.
he is given a consecutive description of the destination from his location.


5km east
2km west
5km north
2km east
4km north

                             4km(14km)(final destination)
                              ^
                              |
                 5km(8km) -->2km(10km)
                  ^
                  |
(start)5km----->(3km)<--2km

his shortest grid destination is 14km

explanation:
Dennis is told to walk 5km towards the east and walk 2km towards the west (backward), 
then 5km towards the north and then 2km to the east and finally 4km northward
for Dennis to save time, he cuts out the direction that are not necessary and calculates the total.

Your task:
write a function to calculate the shortest grid to his destination. 
The function should recieve an array collection of directions of length N in the format of the distance and direction ['3km-north']
the function should return the shortest grid distance to be covered in the format Mkm where M is the distance in km

example:
gridDistance(['2km-west', '4km-south', '0km-north', '12km-east']) => 14km
gridDistance(['5km-east', '2km-west', '5km-north', '2km-east', '4km-north']) => 14km


considerations:
0 <= N <= 100
0 <= M
