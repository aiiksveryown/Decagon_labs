A group of maths scholars have solutions to share among themselves in a competion, 
but this solution would have to pass through their opponents to get to there team members
the have chosen to encrypt a the solution with a mathematical computing technique such that:

"a + b"  would be ab+
"a + b - c" would be ab+c-
"a + b * c" would be abc*+
"a * b + c" would be ab*c+
"a + c * b - d / e" would be acb*+de/- 
"a * d - b + c" would be ad*b-c+ 

other considerations
"( 4 - 9 )" would be 49-
"7 + ( 4 - 9 ) * 6" would be 749-6*+

your task should you choose to accept, is to create a function that takes the actual mathematical expression as a string
and return the encrypted version as a string.

hint: 
the BODMAS principle is used
the Others operation is not considered
every character is spaced
operand are characters with 0-9, a-z and A-Z
operators are +, *, -, /, (, and )

example:
mathEncrypt("a * d / f") => "ad*f/"
mathEncrypt("( b - c )") => "bc-"
mathEncrypt("5 * ( 6 + 7 * 2 )") => "5672*+*
